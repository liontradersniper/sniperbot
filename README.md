# Sniperbot (ICT Trading Simulation)

This repository contains a simulated trading bot based on the Inner Circle Trader (ICT) methodology. It connects to the Bybit Testnet API, analyzes 5-minute candle data, detects Break of Structure (BOS) and Fair Value Gaps (FVG), and simulates trades with fixed SL/TP logic.
