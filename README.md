# Sniperbot (ICT Trading Simulation)

This project contains a small trading simulator based on the Inner Circle Trader (ICT) methodology. It connects to the Bybit Testnet API, retrieves 5‑minute candles, detects Break of Structure (BOS) and Fair Value Gaps (FVG), and then simulates trades with fixed stop‑loss and take‑profit levels.

> ⚠️ Simulation only – no real orders are sent to the exchange.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liontradersniper/sniperbot.git
cd sniperbot
